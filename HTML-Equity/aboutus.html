    rights, live with dignity and respect, and are offered equitable opportunities to thrive.</p>
  <h3>Goals</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Raise awareness and understanding of systemic inequities.</li>
    <li>Increase the accessibility and impact of Josephine County-based events and

  </ol>
  <hr>
  <p>For 2021, The Equity Project has strategically chosen to lead with the issues of race and
    housing. We provide communications and networking support to existing groups and organizations addressing these issues in Josephine County, connect individuals to opportunities for learning and action, as well as help new action groups form.
